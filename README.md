# RayTracers
This repository stores the RayTracers I thinker with.

Each branch contains a different ray tracer implementation. In Java, Cpp etc..
The theoritical backgorund for most -if not all- of these implementations is described in the slides from BME's Computer Graphics class. (see slides in the 'prezi' folder.


Feel free to try or reuse any of these ray tracers.
